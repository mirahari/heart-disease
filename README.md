# Heart Disease Dataset 
### Exploratory Data Analysis and Predictive Modelling (Using R)

<br>
According to the World Health Organization, heart disease has been the greatest killer among diseases worldwide over the past 20 years. Every year, heart diseases have caused an estimated 17.9 million mortalities globally. It now accounts for 16% of total mortalities from all causes.

Hence, it is essential to be knowledgeable about the symptoms and factors of heart disease as it is a major public health concern. By analyzing the healthcare data, we can gain profound insights into the disease. We can also use predictive modeling to predict the diagnosis, which may assist in the early detection and prevention of heart disease.
