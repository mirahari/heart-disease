According to the World Health Organization, heart disease has been the greatest killer among diseases worldwide over the past 20 years. Every year, heart diseases have caused an estimated 17.9 million mortalities globally. It now accounts for 16% of total mortalities from all causes.

As heart disease is a major public health concern, it is essential to be knowledgeable about the symptoms and factors of heart disease. By analyzing the healthcare data, we can gain profound insights into the disease. Predictive modeling can also be used to predict the diagnosis, which may assist in the early detection and prevention of heart disease.
